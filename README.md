This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized. The `Bug.js` file shows the buggy code, resulting in an error when the component renders before the state updates.  The `BugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, using the `useEffect` hook and optional chaining to handle the uninitialized state gracefully. The issue typically arises due to asynchronous state updates, where the component attempts to access the state before it's fully populated. This example showcases how to handle the error to prevent unexpected behavior or application crashes.
